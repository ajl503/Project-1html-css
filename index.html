<p>	For starters, my name is Alex Lucy. At 11:21pm on September 30th, 1989 I entered this world in Clackamas, OR. My mother
Cindy, and father Willam (He always went by Scott) were ecstatic to welcome their first son into their world. Fast forward 26
years later, and here I'am. I grew up and have spent my whole life in Northeast Portland, and love the city entirely. Anyways, 
now that you know a little bit about where I'm from, let me tell you a little about my professional side. For the past five years
I have been in the security industry. The last almost three being in loss prevention (I'm the person who apprehends shoplifters).

One day last summer, I happened to be walking in a park with a couple friends, when one of them mentioned a website called Teamtreehouse.com.
He began to explain that Teamtreehouse.com offered free online training for a variety of different programming languages, and that it was something
I should look into. After looking at the logistics on where the IT (information Technology) field is going, I knew it was something I felt secure devoting
my time to. At the beginning of December, 2015 I decided to enroll in the web design course Teamtreehouse.com offered. After about four months, I was able to complete
the course, and I'm currently working on completing the web developing course. My current goal is to learn as much as possible about web design/developing, and eventually secure
a job as a full time web developer.
